## Audit Summary

The application was heavily reliant on client-side rendering and data fetching, leading to several issues:
-   **Data Synchronization Problems:** Different pages (e.g., Habits page, Entry page) were fetching the same data independently, causing inconsistencies when data was updated in one place but not immediately reflected in another.
-   **Architectural Complexity:** The use of a custom hook (`useHabitData`) to manage client-side data fetching, caching, and state management added unnecessary complexity and was not aligned with the latest Next.js best practices.
-   **Performance:** Fetching data on the client-side can lead to slower perceived performance, as the page first needs to load the JavaScript, which then makes further requests to the server to get the data.

## Recommendations and Implemented Changes

To address these issues, a significant architectural refactoring was performed to align the application with the modern Next.js app router paradigm, which emphasizes server-side rendering and server actions.

The following key changes were implemented:

### 1.  Server-Side Data Fetching

-   **Centralized Data Fetching:** A new server-side utility file, `src/lib/habits.ts`, was created to centralize all data fetching logic related to habits. The `getHabitData` function in this file fetches all necessary data (habits, logs, stats, etc.) directly from the database on the server.
-   **Server Components:** The main pages of the application were converted to server components to fetch data on the server before rendering. This includes:
    -   `src/app/habits/page.tsx`
    -   `src/app/entry/[...slug]/page.tsx`
    -   `src/app/summary/[year]/[month]/page.tsx`
-   **Props-based Data Flow:** Data is now fetched in the server component pages and passed down to client components as props. This ensures a unidirectional data flow and eliminates the need for client-side data fetching for initial page load.

### 2.  Server Actions for Mutations

-   **Centralized Mutations:** A new file, `src/app/actions.ts`, was created to house all server actions responsible for data mutations (creating, updating, and deleting data).
-   **Simplified Client Components:** Client components that perform mutations now call these server actions directly, instead of making `fetch` requests to API routes. This simplifies the client-side code and improves security.
-   **Data Revalidation:** Server actions use `revalidatePath` to trigger a re-render of the pages with fresh data after a mutation, ensuring that the UI is always up-to-date.

### 3.  Component Refactoring

-   **Separation of Concerns:** Client components were refactored to separate data display from interactivity. For example, the `HabitsPage` was split into a server component (`page.tsx`) for data fetching and a client component (`HabitsDashboard.tsx`) for handling user interactions.
-   **Removed Redundant Code:** The `useHabitData` hook was removed, as its functionality is now handled by server-side data fetching and server actions. This significantly simplifies the client-side state management.

## Benefits of the New Architecture

-   **Improved Performance:** Pages now load faster as the data is fetched on the server and rendered as part of the initial HTML response.
-   **Simplified Codebase:** The removal of client-side data fetching logic and the centralization of mutations in server actions make the code easier to understand, maintain, and debug.
-   **Enhanced Security:** Using server actions for mutations is more secure than exposing API endpoints that can be called from the client.
-   **Better User Experience:** The data synchronization issues are resolved, providing a more consistent and reliable user experience.
