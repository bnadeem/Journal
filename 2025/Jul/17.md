weird feeling today.  this was expected.  Yesterday I spent lots of time with my father alone.  My sisters felt it and so did my mom.  My mom doesn't like me spending time with my father.
My mother is very cunning.  I need to think through this to protect my family. 

I also need to launch this app.  Need to focus on why I am here.  Need to make my own decisions.
