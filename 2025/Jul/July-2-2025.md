I'm not sure what is happening.  I feel weird. A bit loss.  Maybe I should let it be.  Maybe I need time to sort things out.  

Is LMSMOre the right future?  I am not sure.  I'm lacking conviction.  Maybe the way to sort it out is to think deeply about the product.  I need to think deep.  How things stack up.  There are many factors

## Factors
1. I want to accomplish something.  have something ready
2. I am lacking conviction in LMSMore and that's why it's brining the whole plan down.  
3. Is it lack of marketing that's not driving the product. 
4. What other products are there for me to build
5. Will AI take over anyways?
