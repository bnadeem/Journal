I had a good day today - feel much better. 

For the past few days, was feeling a bit low.  I feel better today.  I think the thing that bothered me was that I was loosing hope of progress in life - was feeling trapped.  

However there is a way.  

I watched a few videos on boredom.  boredom is very important.  forces you to do something about it.  It helps with your mind.  you can be in your imaginations - plan your future.  look at your current state.  its very very important to be bored.  It's a crucial method.  

Regarding exercise, the slow and steady is taking place now.  I feel more energized.  I actually feel like doing single kettlebell swing.  Just need to do it daily for a week.  I need to be patient.  slow and steady.  It's important.  

This is pretty good
