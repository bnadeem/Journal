Had a weird day.  started off motivated - slept really well though.

I think what's bothering me is the nagging tax document that I have to collect.  getting over it. 

I need to consider myself as a product.  Need to form habits.  Maybe I should read the atomic habits again.  

I did continue my daily kettlebell swings.  Trying to combine it together for just before I start my work.  I need to then take a shower right after.  I need to stick to it.  Also, it looks like, to form new habits, they need to be there for atleast 2 weeks.  

I did color my beard color black.  Wanted to give myself some time.   I need to truly focus on my skills that I should have as a product.   What are the features.  I think the first one is to be commit to what you promised yourself.  For example, the kettlebell swings is on consistent.  

I need to think more on what are my features.   I need to develop this.  Once I have good properties, success will come.
