# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview

This is a personal journal repository containing daily markdown entries organized by year and month in the format `YYYY/MMM/DD.md` (e.g., `2025/Sep/4.md`). The repository follows a simple hierarchical structure:

```
2025/
├── Jul/
├── Aug/
└── Sep/
```

## File Structure and Naming Convention

- **Entry Files**: Daily journal entries are stored as `{day}.md` files within month directories
- **Directory Structure**: `{YEAR}/{Month}/` where months are abbreviated (Jul, Aug, Sep, etc.)
- **Content Format**: Plain text markdown files containing personal reflections and daily thoughts

## Common Operations

Since this is a journal repository with no build system or dependencies, common operations are limited to:

- **Creating new entries**: Create new `.md` files following the `YYYY/MMM/DD.md` pattern
- **Organizing entries**: Ensure proper year/month directory structure exists before creating entries
- **Git operations**: Standard git commands for version control of journal entries

## Repository Characteristics

- **No build system**: Pure markdown content with no compilation or build processes
- **No dependencies**: No package.json, requirements.txt, or other dependency files
- **No testing framework**: Content-based repository with no automated tests
- **Simple structure**: Minimal file organization focused on chronological content storage

## Working with Journal Entries

When creating or modifying journal entries:
- Maintain the established date-based directory structure
- Use `.md` extension for all journal entries
- Create month directories as needed when adding entries for new months
- Follow the existing simple markdown format used in existing entries
